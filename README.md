**Osoroshi** is a private Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheat made in Python. All the offsets are from [the hazedumper github page](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper "the hazedumper github page") so if cheat is not working, retry after day or two.  If you want to contribute, be free to send me a message on discord **Theos#2613**.

# Warning

------------


**Osoroshi** is a cheat and there is risk of VAC. I have only tested **Osoroshi** on private servers with VAC disabled and recommend you do the same.** I do not encourage cheating in any form!**

The cheat has its flaws and sometimes crashes but most of the times problems can be fixed with a restart.
